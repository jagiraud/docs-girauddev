## Overview

If you have been assigned a licence for Visual Studio Enterprise, you might be aware that it also includes $150 monthly credits in Azure. This document will guide you through the setup process and transferring to your personal tenant (assuming that you have one).

:::note
Transferring the subscription is of course optional, but in most cases this is beneficial due to insufficient privileges or not want to setup your own DNS/custom domains in company tenant etc.

   1. are in the correct tenant (lab/personal)
   2. have sufficient privileges to invite guest users

:::caution

:::note
NOTE: It can take a while (~1-2 hours) before the subscription appears in your personal tenant.
